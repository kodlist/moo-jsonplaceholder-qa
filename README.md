Test automation work built for testing restful apis using [Karate unified test automation framework](https://github.com/intuit/karate)

## Task for today

<table>
  <tr> To complete the exercises below, please use this API. There are more details on the resources available for this API in the Readme here.

As a client of this API, I want to be able to:
Get a list of the following attributes about a user
Name
Username
Email
Phone
Website
Get a 404 status code when retrieving the details of an invalid user
Get a 200 status code when retrieving the details of a valid user
Create a new user
Delete a user
See the following fields in the header of a response when getting a list of users:
Cache-Control => public
Connection => keep-alive
Content-Type => application/json

Please write automated checks that cover these scenarios
Please write two additional pieces of acceptance criteria that describe other behaviours of the API, and implement checks for those as well
Please write a ReadMe for your test framework - the reviewer of your code should be able to run the tests you write using only the ReadMe
   </tr>
